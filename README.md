My background is in marine geology and geophysics. Though I am still an active member within that research community, I have recently broadened my skill set to work with data of all types and not just in scientific data analysis. I am passionate about open-source projects and believe that open collaboration and accessibility yields creative approaches to solving difficult problems. 

As a father of two young children, I have become inspired to be a part of something that contributes positively to our planet and all of its inhabitants. By expanding my practical skills in the world of Data Science and Analytics, I am currently looking for a position that will allow me to apply my personal interests, assets, and experience to this goal.

My passion tends to lie with data visualization and storytelling. I enjoy the process of generating beautiful figures that communicate the story of the data. I think of data visualization as an artform and enjoy casual exploration of the theory as a whole.
